Project Description

This project is the first step toward building a full clone of the AirBnB web application. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) that lets you create, update, delete, and manage data models, similar to how a real backend works, it provides a custom command-line interpreter to manage all AirBnB objects (User, State, City, Place, etc.). As you progress through the project series, you will reuse and extend these components for HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.
